# Biodiversity Credit FHE: Transforming Conservation into Currency 🌿💰

Biodiversity Credit FHE is an innovative ReFi platform that harnesses **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to issue biodiversity credits through FHE-encrypted data from protected areas. By allowing project stakeholders—such as national parks—to submit species monitoring data securely, the platform evaluates their ecological contributions while maintaining data privacy. This results in the issuance of tradeable “biodiversity credit” NFTs, merging environmental conservation with financial opportunities.

## The Challenge of Conservation Funding

As global biodiversity continues to decline, securing funds for conservation efforts poses a significant challenge. Traditional funding models often lack transparency and fail to incentivize long-term ecological stewardship. Conservationists and organizations face difficulty in quantifying their contributions to biodiversity and mobilizing financial resources effectively. Without innovative solutions, vital areas of ecological importance risk being overlooked or underfunded.

## FHE: A Game-Changer for Biodiversity Conservation

Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption provides a robust solution to the funding challenge by enabling confidential and secure data analysis. This allows biodiversity-related metrics to be evaluated without exposing sensitive information. Using Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, the platform can perform homomorphic operations directly on encrypted data, ensuring that organizations can demonstrate their environmental impact transparently while keeping their data private. Through this, biodiversity credits are not only created but also trusted and verified, leading to greater financial backing for conservation efforts.

## Core Functionalities 🌱

- **FHE-Encrypted Data Submission:** Organizations can submit sensitive biodiversity data without fear of exposure.
- **Homomorphic Credit Evaluation:** The platform utilizes homomorphic encryption to assess contributions without decrypting data, ensuring confidentiality.
- **Tradeable Biodiversity NFTs:** Once contributions are evaluated, organizations receive tradeable NFTs representing their biodiversity credits, allowing them to monetize their conservation efforts.
- **Marketplace for Credits:** A dedicated marketplace where biodiversity credits can be bought, sold, and traded, creating liquidity for conservation financing.
- **Standardized Evaluation Metrics:** The platform provides standardized metrics for assessing biodiversity contributions, fostering trust and transparency among stakeholders.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Zama SDK**: Essential for confidential computing via Fully Homomorphic Encryption
- **Node.js**: Server-side environment for building the platform
- **Hardhat**: Development environment to compile and test Ethereum smart contracts
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language for NFT issuance and transactions
- **IPFS**: For decentralized storage of biodiversity data and NFT metadata

## Installation Instructions 📦

To get started with Biodiversity Credit FHE, follow these setup instructions:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
   - Install Hardhat, which will help with contract deployment and testing.

2. **Setup**:
   - Download the project files (do not use `git clone`).
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `npm install` to fetch all necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries.

## Build & Run the Project 🚀

To test and deploy the smart contracts, follow these commands in your terminal:

1. **Compile Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

## Example Usage 📜

Here is a simple code snippet demonstrating how an organization can submit their biodiversity data:

```javascript
const { encryptData, evaluateCredit } = require('./submissionHandler');

async function submitBiodiversityData(data) {
    const encryptedData = await encryptData(data);
    const credit = await evaluateCredit(encryptedData);
    console.log(`Biodiversity Credit Issued: ${credit}`);
}

// Example of submitting biodiversity data
submitBiodiversityData({
    species: 'Endangered Species XYZ',
    population: 150,
    areaProtected: 'Nature Park ABC'
});
```

This code demonstrates how to encrypt biodiversity data and evaluate its contribution using the platform’s FHE capabilities.
